This could undermine the very goals of public health and harm reduction that the bill seeks to achieve.\nFurthermore, our business and many others in our industry are already subject to rigorous regulations and high taxes, such as the 95% tax on all tobacco products in Minnesota. Implementing further restrictions could severely impact our livelihoods and the livelihoods of our employees. It is crucial to consider the economic repercussions on small businesses like mine before enacting such legislation.\nMoreover, flavored tobacco products constitute a significant portion of our sales, and banning them would undoubtedly result in a substantial loss of revenue. This could lead to job losses and even business closures, particularly for small businesses already facing challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic.\nIn conclusion, while I share the state's commitment to public health, I urge the committee to seek alternative solutions that prioritize both health objectives and the economic well-being of small businesses.

        "_FIRSTNAME_\n_LASTNAME_\n_STREETADDRESS_\n_ADDRESS_\n_DATE_\n\n\nSubject: Opposition to Minnesota HF 2177 - Prohibition of Flavored Tobacco Products\nDear Committee Members\nAs a responsible and law-abiding small business owner in the tobacco industry, I am writing to express my strong opposition to Minnesota HF 2177, a proposed bill that seeks to prohibit the sale or offer for sale of flavored tobacco products. I urge the committee to reconsider this proposal, taking into account its potential adverse effects on both public health and local businesses.\n1. Public Health Considerations:\n\nWhile I appreciate the state's commitment to promoting public health, I believe that an outright ban on flavored tobacco products may have unintended consequences. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n	 Consumer Behavior: Prohibiting flavored tobacco products could drive consumers toward unregulated sources or more harmful alternatives. It is essential to strike a balance between regulation and harm reduction to achieve the desired health outcomes.\n		Harm Reduction Goals: The bill's intention aligns with harm reduction objectives. However, we must ensure that the proposed measures do not inadvertently lead to unintended negative consequences.\n\n2. Economic Impact on Small Businesses:\n\nOur business, like many others in the industry, already operates under rigorous regulations and faces high taxes. For instance, Minnesota imposes a 95% tax on all tobacco products. Implementing further restrictions could significantly impact our livelihoods and the well-being of our employees. Small businesses need thoughtful consideration before enacting legislation that affects their operations.\n\n3. Revenue and Job Loss:\n\nFlavored tobacco products constitute a substantial portion of our sales. Banning these products would undoubtedly result in a significant revenue loss. Moreover, job losses and potential business closures would disproportionately affect small businesses, especially those still recovering from pandemic-related challenges.\n\n4. Seeking a Balanced Approach:\n\nIn conclusion, I share the state's commitment to public health. However, I encourage the committee to explore alternative solutions that achieve a balance between health objectives and economic viability for small businesses. Evidence-based approaches can help us find common ground while preserving the integrity of our industry.\n\nThank you for considering my perspective and advocating for the interests of small businesses like mine during your deliberations on this critical matter.\n\n_FIRSTNAME_\n_LASTNAME_",

As a business owner in the tobacco industry, I urge the committee to reconsider this bill due to its potential adverse effects on revenue and commerce.\n\nImplementing a ban on flavored tobacco products would significantly impact my business and many others in the industry. Flavored products constitute a substantial portion of our sales, and the sudden prohibition would result in a substantial loss of revenue. This loss could have severe consequences for the viability of our businesses and the livelihoods of our employees.\n\nFurthermore, the interruption to commerce caused by such a ban would be detrimental to local economies. Small businesses like mine contribute to the economic vitality of our communities, and any measure that hampers our ability to operate would have ripple effects throughout the supply chain.\n\nI understand the importance of public health initiatives, but I believe there are alternative approaches that can achieve the desired outcomes without resorting to prohibition. Instead of banning flavored tobacco products outright, I urge the committee to consider implementing regulations that balance public health concerns with the economic viability of businesses like mine.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the committee to reconsider HF 2177 and its potential impact on revenue and commerce. Let us work together to find solutions that promote public health while also supporting small businesses and local economies.\n\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\n_FIRSTNAME_\n_LASTNAME_"

As a constituent and business owner in Minnesota, I urge you to reconsider supporting this ban. While addressing youth vaping is important, banning flavored products could lead adult smokers to traditional cigarettes or online purchases. This overlooks the economic impact on businesses, tax revenue, and job losses.
